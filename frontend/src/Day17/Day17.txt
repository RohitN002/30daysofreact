In this lab, you will create a simple yet functional accordion component using React. An accordion is a UI pattern consisting of collapsible items, typically used for displaying FAQs or other content in a space-efficient manner. Your task is to build an accordion where only one item's content is displayed at a time.

Steps to Build the App
Create the Accordion Component: Design your accordion component with the necessary HTML structure and React state logic.

Each accordion item should be a div with a class accordion. Inside this, include two child div elements: one with a class question for the item title, and another with a class answer for the item content.
Implement Global State: Use React's state management to control which accordion item is open by default. Initially, the first item should be open, and the rest collapsed.

Add Interactive Behavior: Implement functionality that allows users to click on an accordion item to view its content. Clicking another item should close the currently open item and open the new one.

Render Multiple Items: Ensure your app contains exactly four accordion items, each adhering to the specified structure.

Example Markup
Here's a simple example of what the HTML structure of your accordion component might look like:

<div className="accordion">
    <div className="question">Question 1</div>
    <div className="answer">Answer 1</div>
</div>
<div className="accordion">
    <div className="question">Question 2</div>
    <div className="answer">Answer 2</div>
</div>

Challenges Information
Challenge 1: Accordion Structure
Objective: Construct the accordion with the correct HTML structure.
Details: Each accordion item should be a div with a class of accordion. Inside this, there should be two child div elements: one with a class of question and the other with a class of answer.
Expectation: Your accordion should have the correct parent and child elements with the specified classes. This structure is crucial for the functionality and styling of the component.
Challenge 2: Implementing Global State
Objective: Manage the accordion's state globally.
Details: Use a global state to control which accordion item is opened by default when the page loads. The first FAQ should be open, and the others should be collapsed initially.
Expectation: Your implementation should ensure only the first accordion item is expanded initially. This tests your ability to use state effectively in React.
Challenge 3: Interactive Accordion Behavior
Objective: Create a functional accordion where only one item is visible at a time.
Details: Implement functionality where clicking an accordion item toggles its visibility. If another item is clicked, the currently open item should collapse, and the clicked item should expand.
Expectation: Ensure that clicking an accordion item correctly toggles the visibility of its content. This tests event handling and state updates based on user interaction.
Challenge 4: Multiple Accordion Elements
Objective: Populate the page with multiple accordions.
Details: The page should contain exactly four accordion elements, each following the specified structure (div.accordion with child div.question and div.answer).
Expectation: Accurately rendering multiple accordion elements tests your ability to replicate components in React while maintaining consistency and functionality.
