Instructions
You don’t need to worry about styling your application as we have already done it for you. But if you wish to update the styles, you can use styled-components, inline style or tailwindcss.
Do not edit the data-testid attributes.
Hints
You should write two handler functions, one to select individual checkboxes, and the second to select all of them.
